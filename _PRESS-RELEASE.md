HEADING

Roller Coster

SUB-HEADING

The market is people who are either interested in knowing how their spending on different items compares to others (in a clickbaity sense) OR people who want to have statistical data on people's spending habits (which are collected in surveys).

SUMMARY

The product has two mostly distinct functionalities. The first is for the typical user who does not have particular interest in bugeting, money management etc., but is inclined enough to find out how, as a percentage of thier income, thier spending on typical products (i.e. groceries, clothes etc.) compares to others and more specifically other peers with similar demographics. This is a one time or occassional (user comes back later to compare old spending habits with new) use case. The other functionality is aggregating this user input data and providing some statistics on the variance in spending for different products controlled for demographics

PROBLEM

The principal problem the product solves is giving people an understanding of how their spending habits compare to peers to assess the reasonableness of their spending or validate the unreasonableness of other people as compared to the sound spending of the user. The other problem this intends to solve is how to get data on people's spending habits. 

SOLUTION

The app solves the problem by giving a user a one time survey to gather data (low user cost), as well as rewarding them with immediate feedback on their spending habits. We can store and manipulate this data server side with a database

COSTUMER QUOTE

"I enjoyed the reassurance this app gave me that my spending habits are pretty good overall."
